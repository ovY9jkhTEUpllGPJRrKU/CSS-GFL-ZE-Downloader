# CS:S GFL ZE Downloader
## Important
Please look at https://web.archive.org/web/20230806221759/https://gflclan.com/topic/84392-map-downloader/ (Archived in case the site ever disappears for unknown reasons).\
I may have posted updates on there and using wget2 + 7-zip executable (or lbzip2 if someone creates a binary for windows) is a lot faster to work with. 

## Instructions
1. Run `CSS Downloader.exe`
2. After everything is done downloading, go to `file\gflfastdlv2\cstrike\maps\`
3. Extract all the maps into cstrike\download\maps\
4. Make sure to drop it in your `cstrike\download` folder:
```
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Source\cstrike\download\
    |___maps
    |___materials
    |___models
    |___resource
    |___sound
```
